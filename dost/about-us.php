            <p>Cagayan Valley Research and Development Knowledge Management System (CVRDKMS) functions as DOST RO2’s official online repository of researches conducted by academic and other institutions in the region, which are aligned with the research thrusts of DOST. It is also a system for monitoring research grants approved, hosted, and funded by the department.
              </p>
              <p>
                
The repository shall contain digitized copies of abstract and full-text of scholarly articles written by researchers of colleges, universities, and other institutions in the Region. The aims are to collect, preserve, and provide free access to these researches produced by students, faculty and other scholars.

              </p>
              <p>
                The objectives of the repository are: (1) to create global visibility and promotion of scholarly researches in the Region; (2) to provide a central database/repository of regional research collections; and (3) to provide open access to research outputs in the Region. 
              </p>
              <p>In the long run, the repository shall serve to track the Region’s research productivity per higher education institution or agency, and per discipline, and to generate statistics on publications and research awards. Ultimately, it shall serve to identify and address gaps in research.</p>
